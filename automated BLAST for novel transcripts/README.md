The purpose of this project is to make connections from novel transcripts found in Nanopore sequencing data to protein abundance as found by proteomics. In particular, we would like to identify if any of these novel transcripts are antisense to proteins found to decrease in abundance in our proteomics data, indicating the mechanism of the decrease to be silencing.

The NCBI provides [files](https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/DATA/) that map between gene, transcript, and protein identifiers. This particular resource is helpful because it is one of the few I've found that includes RefSeq IDs, the most useful identifier of nBLAST results.
